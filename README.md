HACOGen - hardware compressor generator


Hardware compressor generator (HACOGen), written in Chisel, generates
hardware compressor Verilog codes that compresses input data in a
streaming manner (without stall).  Just starting up a project. It only
generates a simple zero-skimming compressor at this point. The codes
are not well-organized now. I will add more details here and sort out
and improve the codes one by one.
